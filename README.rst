Customize how to send your newsletter
-------------------------------------

By default, this product send all the emails through the standard plone mailer.
The actual sending mechanism is handled by an adapter (a multi-adapter)::

  <adapter
    for="rer.newsletter.behaviors.ships.IShippableMarker
         zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserRequest"
    provides=".base_adapter.IChannelSender"
    factory=".base_adapter.BaseAdapter"
  />


To change this default activity, you can create a new Plone add-on that
register a new adapter with a more specific layer (e.g. use the browser layer
of the new add-on) and override the ``sendMessage`` method as you wish.

`rer.newsletterplugin.flask <https://github.com/RegioneER/rer.newsletterplugin.flask>`__ is an example
of plugin with a custom sender. It uses an external Flask app to send emails.


Advanced security
-----------------

New permissions have been added for the management of the Newsletter:

- ``rer.newsletter: Add Channel``
- ``rer.newsletter: Add Message``
- ``rer.newsletter: Manage Newsletter``
- ``rer.newsletter: Send Newsletter``

This permission are assigned to Manager and Site Administrator. There is also
a new role, ``Gestore Newsletter``, which has permissions for all possible
operations on newsletter.


Bot protection

This product use `collective.honeypot <https://pypi.org/project/collective.honeypot/>`__ to prevent bot submissions.

You just need to set two environment variables:

- *EXTRA_PROTECTED_ACTIONS customer-satisfaction-add*
- *HONEYPOT_FIELD xxx*

xxx should be a field name that bot should compile.

users that not have confirmed subscription to a channel in time.
